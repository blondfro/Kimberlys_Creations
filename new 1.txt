s there any way to have multiple distinct HTML pages contained within a single HTML file? For example, suppose I have a website with two pages:

Page 1 : click here for page 2

and

Page 2 : click here for page 1

Can I create a single HTML file that embeds simple static HTML for both pages but only displays one at a time? My actual pages are of course more complicated with images, tables and javascript to expand table rows. I would prefer to avoid too much script code. Thanks!

why would you want to avoid two hmtl pages? – Tim B James Nov 21 '11 at 11:37
   	 
	
I have a program that dumps thousands of small, interlinked HTML files as debug output. It would be much more convenient to have just one file output. – paperjam Nov 21 '11 at 11:40

"why would you want to" are non-constructive questions. Suppose I want to give someone a single "foo.html" file which appears to have multiple pages inside it, rather than a "foo.zip" which they have to unpack somewhere and then find the "index.html" in. – Kaz Jun 3 '16 at 15:10

Well, you could, but you probably just want to have two sets of content in the same page, and switch between them. Example:

<html>
<head>
<script>
function show(shown, hidden) {
  document.getElementById(shown).style.display='block';
  document.getElementById(hidden).style.display='none';
  return false;
}
</script>
</head>
<body>

  <div id="Page1">
    Content of page 1
    <a href="#" onclick="return show('Page2','Page1');">Show page 2</a>
  </div>

  <div id="Page2" style="display:none">
    Content of page 2
    <a href="#" onclick="return show('Page1','Page2');">Show page 1</a>
  </div>

</body>
</html>
